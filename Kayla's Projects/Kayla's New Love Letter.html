        <h1>Dear My Bookie Dookie Butt Kayla,</h1>
        <p>
            You know, my handwriting is not good, so I decided to make this.<br>
            You know what they say, 'I loved you to the point of invention' – Shit quote btw.<br>
            I've been thinking a lot about us (obviously because I'm with you most days).<br>
            I want to express to you what has been on my mind for the last... I wanna say 4 months?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fair warning:</strong> There is gonna be a lot of 'I' in this because this is about how I feel.
        </p>
        <p>
            I appreciate you a lot. It's crazy how a human can be such a breath of fresh air.<br>
            Honestly, I did not think we would make it to this point. The best gamble of my life.<br>
            I've loved every second with you; it's been fun and irritating at the same time.<br>
            We understand each other a good bit, which means a lot because I don't understand myself sometimes.<br>
            I admire so many of your characteristics... you're kind, strong-willed, <em>*whispers*</em> funny...<br>
            Beautiful, faithful, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, I cannot see a future without you in it. I know you will do great things, and whatever<br>
            God has planned for our path, I will follow blindly in faith.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're already my baby, but I want to ask officially because you deserve all the romantics.<br>
            Kayla Greene, will you be my girlfriend and promise to love me as long as you can?<br>
            I'm not worried about our past, future... just the right now. Every day; together with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm always gonna be difficult – not sorry, looking forward to it!
        </p>
